  TechStack: ["Unity", "C#"],
  Features: [
    "I led a team in creating a third-person, isometric stealth strategy game. A series of missions were offered to the players where resources and intel are provided through each level.",
    "Players control a box that is out to take revenge against Company A. They must use the resources at their disposal to avoid or takedown enemies and traps and navigate further into Company A's headquarters. ",
    "Each mission is scored based on how stealthy the players conducted themselves. A timer is also recorded for each level to encourage players to try new strategies and beat their own records.",
    "Players can take advantage of several camera perspectives to plan strategies including the traditional third person mode and top down isometric view the latter being provided by an X-Ray drone that can slightly be controlled to rotate angles from above.",
    "This provides an enriching experience as players who utilise this tool are rewarded by finding paths or items to help them complete levels faster."
